# Antenea wordpress theme

This repo contains the source files of the ancient wordpress theme.

# CDN

Since the wordpress is very slow for static files serving we are using netlfify for cdn. In order to serve sth. push whatever you want to branch `cdn`, all content from `cdn` folder is then served via netlify.
